                <h1>What is an Operating System?</h1>
                <p>
                    An <dfn>operating system</dfn> is low-level software—programmed close to the level of machine code.
                    It allows users to interface with the hardware by managing higher-level software and the 
                    computer's basic functions; management, allocation, and execution of computer storages, resources, 
                    and the communication of devices connected through the I/O ports or wireless connection (peripherals).

                <h1>What are the main purposes of an <abbr title="Operating System">OS</abbr></h1>
                <p>
                    The primary purpose of an operating system is to provide an interface between the hardware to user, higher-level programs (applications) to the hardware,
                     alongside the management of the filesystem. Such as displaying a graphical user interface (GUI) through the attached monitor (device peripheral), or 
                     interpreting inputs from a keyboard driver so the user can write a command into a shell, which the kernel will execute.

                <h1>Linux and the Linux Kernal</h1>
                <p>
                Linux and Linux Kernal are like the pea and the pea pod. Linux is a versatile open-source operating system with a hierarchical file system. 
                This operating system can operate multiple tasks simultaneously (multitasking), and allows multiple users access simultaneously (multi-user). 
                Linux Kernal is the software that interfaces any higher-level software to the hardware through the management of I/O and core processes. 
                Essentially, the Kernal translates and manages data through management of the hardware. 
                The kernel is the core of the operating system, but not the entire operating system. 
                Only together with the kernel and other software do they form the operating system; 
                Linux is the pea pod that contains the peas: shell, kernel, packaging system, desktop environment, and more.

                <h1>Brief History</h1>
                <p>
                    The “explosion” following the invention of Linux in the 1990s caused the creation of Linux distributions. 
                    A Linux distribution still contains the Linux kernel but has additional GNU software with GPL or similar licensed software; 
                    they can have various software alongside the kernel. For example, Debian uses the Linux kernel and BASH shell, but uses APT as the package manager, 
                    while Red Hat uses YUM as its package manager. 
                    There are many distributions such as OpenSUSE, Red Hat (Fedora, and CentOS), Debian (Ubuntu, Mint, Raspbian), Android, Arch, etc..

                <h1>What is the difference between closed-source and open-source?</h1>
                <p>
                    Most programs/applications need to be compiled ahead of its execution. 
                    The code before compiling is called the source code. 
                    Open-source is software/code that allows viewing, changing, and cloning of source code without usage payments via an open-source license. 
                    The Free Software Foundation's GNU project created GPL (General Project License) which requires that all distributions of GPL licensed code to be distributed with it. 
                    Meaning that anyone can make their own modifications of GNU software and distribute it online so long as it is also under a GPL. 
                    There are other open-source licenses, such as the MIT license or Apache license. A closed-source license does not allow for viewing, 
                    modification, cloning, or distribution, usually not without some sort of financial exchange (copyright). 
                    Companies who have proprietary software use closed-source licensing; they keep source code safely to themselves.
                    All the developers who contribute to shared open code form the open-source community.
                    The most notable contributions are Linux, but there are others such as Apache HTTP server, VS Code, Node.js, LibreOffice, etc..

                <h1>What is a multi-user system?</h1>
                <p>
                    To prevent people who shouldn't have access to certain files, Linux has file permission, and file ownership.
                    File ownership specifies which user owns the file and divides it into three groups: user, group, and other.
                </p>
                <dl>
                    <dt>User</dt>
                    <dd>Owns the file. The user created the file, but a command can change this.</dd>

                    <dt>Group</dt>
                    <dd>Refers to a specific grouping of multiple users</dd>

                    <dt>Others</dt>
                    <dd>anyone with access to the system</dd>
